# CSS---the-Crime-Similarity-System
Police departments are leveraging Information Technology to fight crime, but mostly on a tactical level.  Introducing CSS - the Crime Similarity System ,This Artificial Intelligence software isn't just another tool; it's a game-changer! 



CSS takes into account the socio-economic, crime, and enforcement profiles of cities to provide police departments with strategic insights.  By identifying similar communities, CSS opens doors for collaboration and shared experiences among police departments. ü§ù Imagine the potential for proactive management! 

But here's the kicker: CSS isn't just limited to law enforcement.  Its versatile modeling framework holds promise for a wide range of applications beyond the realm of crime fighting. 

Get ready to revolutionize decision-making and collaboration with CSS! 

Our project, built upon a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, underwent three critical phases:

1. Preprocessing: We tackled poorly formatted data with numerous missing fields and ambiguous features. Our team invested significant effort into organizing the data for modeling.

2. Analysis: Through in-depth analysis, we gained invaluable insights into the relationships between different data features. We visualized these relationships to enhance understanding, revealing the key factors influencing crime rates in civil areas.

3. Modeling: Employing a range of machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, linear regression, and support vector regressor, we aimed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.
